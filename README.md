# The Reading Room Automated Coordinator

## The Problem

Right now, managing a community of 600+ people for 100 seats is a manual marathon. We spend hours tracking WhatsApp messages, managing waitlists, and dealing with "dead seats" from no-shows.

## The Solution

A "Calm-Tech" engine that acts as our digital steward. It automates the repetitive scheduling but leaves the final "human" decisions to us.

## 🛠 The Organizer's Experience (Admin Flow)

This turns your role from a "logistics manager" into a "community host."

### 1. The Hands-Off Monday

The system starts the week for us. At 9:00 AM, the registration portal opens automatically. We don't need to post a link or announce anything. We simply log in to our dashboard and watch the queue build in real-time. If a venue issue pops up, we have a Master Kill Switch that cancels the event and notifies everyone instantly with one click.

### 2. The Tuesday "Roll Out"

Once we have our venue and time confirmed, we perform our only major task of the week. We enter the location and time into the dashboard and hit "Roll Out."

**Smart Invites**: The system automatically identifies the top 100 people.

**The VIP Guard**: If we have core team members or special guests, we put them on a "Priority List." The system guarantees them a spot within that 100, so we never have to worry about our "vibe-setters" missing out.

### 3. The Saturday Waterfall (Self-Healing Queue)

This is the most powerful part. Once invites are out, the system manages the seats:

- **Instant Backfill**: If person #40 says "No," the system instantly invites person #101.
- **The 24-Hour Timer**: If someone is silent for 24 hours, the system assumes they aren't coming and automatically passes the seat to the next person in line.
- **The Weekend Cutoff**: To ensure everyone has time to plan, the "Waterfall" stops on Saturday evening. No one will get a "surprise" invitation on Sunday morning.

## 📖 The Reader's Experience (User Flow)

We want the experience to feel like a high-end club—simple, fair, and professional.

### 1. One-Time Setup

A reader registers and verifies their email just once. After that, they are "recognized" by the system. On Monday morning, they get a notification, tap a single button to "Join the Queue," and they are done. No passwords to remember, no forms to fill out every week.

### 2. The Decision Window

On Tuesday, they receive their invitation with the location and time. They have a clear choice: "Yes, I'll be there" or "No, I can't make it."

**Accountability**: Once they say "Yes," their seat is locked. To keep things clean, they can't change their email address while they have an active invitation—it ensures the person who registered is the one who shows up.

### 3. The "Hero" Cancellation

If a reader says "Yes" on Tuesday but realizes on Friday they are sick, they can release their spot. Because they did this before the Saturday cutoff, the system instantly gifts that seat to the next person waiting. It makes our readers feel good for being responsible.

### 4. The Sunday Handshake

When they arrive, they tap "I am here" on the site. This isn't just for us to track attendance; it unlocks their Reading Log. They can log the book they read and leave a review. By Sunday evening, they can browse the "Digital Library" to see what everyone else in the room was reading, creating a connection that lasts beyond the event.

## 💡 Why This Works for Us

- **We save 4–6 hours a week**: No more manual waitlist tracking.
- **Priority stays Priority**: If a core member can't make it, the seat doesn't go to a random person—the system holds it for us to decide who to invite next.
- **Fairness**: The community sees exactly where they are in line. There is no favoritism, just a transparent, automated process that works.
